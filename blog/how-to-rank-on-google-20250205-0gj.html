            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p class="mb-6">Alright, so you wanna rank on Google, huh? Cool, cool. But let's be real—Google's algorithm is like that one friend who's always changing their mind. One day they're into avocado toast, the next day it's all about matcha lattes. You gotta keep up, or you'll get left behind.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Know What Google Wants (Spoiler: It's Not Just Keywords)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Back in the day, ranking on Google was like playing a game of Mad Libs. Stuff your page with keywords, and boom—you're on the first page. But now? Google's got this thing called E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Yeah, it's a mouthful, but it basically means Google wants to know you're not just some rando spamming the internet.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Content Is King (But It's Also the Whole Damn Kingdom)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Here's the deal: if your content sucks, you're not ranking. Period. Google's all about giving users what they want, so if your blog post reads like it was written by a robot who's never met a human, you're toast.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li>Write for humans, not bots</li>
                    <li>Answer questions people are actually asking</li>
                    <li>Make it skimmable</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Backlinks Are Like Social Proof for Your Website</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Imagine you're at a party, and someone's like, "Oh, you have to meet Sarah. She's amazing." That's what backlinks are—other websites vouching for you. The more high-quality sites linking to you, the more Google thinks, "Hmm, this person must be legit."</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Speed Matters (Like, a Lot)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">If your website loads slower than a dial-up connection in 1998, you're not ranking. Google's all about user experience, and nobody's sticking around for a site that takes forever to load.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li>Optimize your images</li>
                    <li>Use a decent hosting provider</li>
                    <li>Minify your code</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Mobile-Friendly Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Let's be honest—most people are Googling stuff on their phones while they're supposed to be working. If your site looks like a hot mess on mobile, you're not ranking.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Don't Sleep on Technical SEO</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Okay, I know "technical SEO" sounds boring, but it's kinda like the plumbing of your website. If it's messed up, everything else falls apart.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Be Patient (Yeah, I Know, It Sucks)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Here's the thing: ranking on Google doesn't happen overnight. It's more like a slow burn. You gotta put in the work, wait for the algorithm to do its thing, and hope for the best.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Ranking on Google isn't rocket science, but it's not exactly a walk in the park either. It's a mix of good content, solid technical stuff, and a little bit of luck. So, what are you waiting for? Go fix that slow-loading site, write some killer content, and start building those backlinks.</p>
